# Development Logs

## Purpose
Record development sessions with date prefixes and outcome status. Include both successful implementations and failed attempts with lessons learned.

## Naming Pattern
Use date prefix with descriptive outcome:
- `YYYY-MM-DD_feature-name-implementation-success.md`
- `YYYY-MM-DD_bug-fix-attempt-failed.md`
