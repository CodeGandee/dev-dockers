# Context Directory

A standardized directory structure for AI-assisted development projects that helps organize project knowledge, track progress, and maintain development history.

## Purpose

The `context/` directory serves as a centralized knowledge base for AI assistants working on your project. It contains all the context, documentation, and reference materials needed for effective AI collaboration.

## Directory Structure

- **design/**: Technical specifications and architecture
- **hints/**: How-to guides and troubleshooting tips
- **instructions/**: Reusable prompt snippets and commands
- **issues/**: Known and fixed issues
- **logs/**: Development session records and outcomes
- **plans/**: Implementation roadmaps and strategies
- **refcode/**: Reference implementations and examples (Read-only)
- **roles/**: Role-based system prompts and memory
- **rules/**: Task-specific rules for AI coding agents
- **summaries/**: Knowledge base and analysis documents
- **tasks/**: Current and planned work items
- **tools/**: Custom development utilities
